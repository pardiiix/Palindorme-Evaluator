# Palindorme-Evaluator

This code has been written by Pardis Ranjbar Noiey.


a Palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward. Such as Madame.
You can find a list of Palindrome statements at: http://www.palindromelist.net/

This code gets a word and checks whether it is a Palindrome.
It creates 2 Stacks. One forward stack and one backward stack. It pops each stack's top and checks if both stacks have the same character. It continues this method until the stacks are empty.
